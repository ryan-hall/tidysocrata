\description{
Deletes a Socrata dataset revision, identified by \code{dataset_id} and
\code{revision_id}, the revision sequence number. Revisions are numbered
sequentially from 0, the very first revision, and increment by 1 for each
new revision.
}
\details{
A revision id can be identified by looking at the end of the URL of a draft,
i.e. 4 in "/dataset/dataset-name/abcd-1234/revisions/4", or by making a GET
request to "https://yourdomain.gov/api/publishing/v1/revision/abcd-1234",
with your dataset id, finding the most recent or relevant revision, and
locating the \code{revision_seq} number.

When opening a new draft with \code{open_revision}, the \code{revision_id} is returned
with the results.
