# tidysocrata

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)

The goal of tidysocrata is to make it easy to publish, update, and maintain datasets on Socrata
domains, as well as interact with other Socrata APIs.

## Installation

(not yet) You can install the released version of tidysocrata from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("tidysocrata")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(tidysocrata)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.
